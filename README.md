PROJECT7 : 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection Project
✅ Level 2- Task 3

A comprehensive machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using anomaly detection and supervised classification models.

🚀 Project Overview

This project explores a real-world credit card dataset and applies both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to detect fraud. It covers key concepts including anomaly detection, real-time monitoring, and system scalability.

🧠 Key Concepts Implemented

🔍 Anomaly Detection: Isolation Forest for unsupervised outlier detection.

🤖 Machine Learning Models: Random Forest classifier for supervised prediction.

⚙️ Feature Engineering: Scaling and transformation of time and amount features.

🛰️ Real-time Monitoring: Simulated fraud prediction in real-time.

📈 Scalability Planning: Strategy for handling large-scale production systems.


📂 Dataset

-creditcard.csv: Contains 284,807 European credit card transactions with anonymized features and labels indicating fraud (1) or legitimate (0)
